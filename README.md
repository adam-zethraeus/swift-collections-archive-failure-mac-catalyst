## Issues

Root cause unknown. An Xcode build fails to deduplicate `MetaCodable`'s `swift-collections` symbols with those imported by other targets in the repo.

## Fix

In this reproduction repo the archival failure is fixed by:
* Copying `MetaCodable` into a dedicated local SPM package.
* Copying the parts of `swift-collections` used by `MetaCodable` into its SPM package.
* Renaming the copied `InternalCollectionsUtilities` and `OrderedCollections` targets with an `MC` prefix to prevent package graph conflicts.
* Replacing occurrences of the renamed symbols with their updates.
* Resolving warnings about the unsafe runtime use of `@_implementationOnly` in the copied `swift-collections` files (`OrderedCollections` when importing `InternalCollectionsUtilities`) by removing their use and using plain imports.

The issue and fix can be reproduced by swapping from/to the local version of `MetaCodable` in this repo's `Package.swift`.
